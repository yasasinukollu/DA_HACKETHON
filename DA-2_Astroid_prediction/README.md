# ☄️ Asteroid Impact Prediction - ML Model Evaluation Dashboard

This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of asteroids hitting Earth using machine learning techniques. It evaluates multiple ML algorithms on historical and feature-engineered space data, then identifies the best-performing model for accurate predictions.

Built using *Streamlit*, this project also provides an interactive dashboard to visualize model performance, compare accuracy scores, and highlight the top ML algorithm — making it ideal for data scientists and space researchers alike.
